# UX Feedback Analysis with Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

## Overview
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user feedback, including sentiment and emotion analysis, to derive actionable insights for improving user experience (UX). It processes raw user feedback collected from various sources such as surveys, interviews, usability testing, and online reviews. By categorizing sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and detecting underlying emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, fear), this analysis helps identify areas of user satisfaction and pain points, allowing design and product teams to focus on improvements that matter most.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies user feedback into positive, neutral, or negative categories.
- **Emotion Analysis**: Detects specific emotions like joy, anger, sadness, trust, etc., from feedback.
- **Combination of Sentiment and Emotion**: Combines sentiment and emotion data to understand the depth of user feelings.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes sentiment and emotion data using charts (e.g., bar charts, word clouds) to easily interpret feedback.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides insights into what areas are working well and what areas need improvement.
